# SheepDog

## Introduction
SheepDog is a free utility for repositioning off-screen windows.

## What can SheepDog do for me?
SheepDog is useful whenever you have an application or window that you can't access because it is located off your visible screen.

Offscreen windows can occur in a variety of situations, including:
- Switching between monitors on a laptop
- Multiple-screen setup

## How does SheepDog work?
SheepDog runs in the Windows system tray and can be activated in two ways:
- Choosing the "Reposition Windows" menu option after right clicking on SheepDog in the system tray.
- Pressing a hotkey combination. The hotkey defaults to Win+W, but can be changed in the "Options" menu.

When activated, SheepDog will re-position the offscreen all windows back onto your main screen.

SheepDog is, and will always be, free.
